# Operation types

Unless other BlockChains, PascalCoin supports multiple types of operations and
is open to add more than the currently existing 10 operations.

The latest addition to the operation types is the DATA operation integrated 
with [PIP-16](../pips/PIP-0016.md) that allows you to send arbitary data
to other accounts.
